  <h2 id="why-i-chose-management-information-systems">Why I chose Management Information Systems</h2>

<p>During my first two years of college, I struggled with finding the right major for me. Although I was inclined toward business-related fields, I was uncertain about the specific direction to take within that broad category. I initially considered economics, then accounting, and finally finance. Briefly, I also entertained the idea of studying computer science and even enrolled in some introductory classes. Despite these explorations, none of the subjects ignited the passion I was seeking, leaving me somewhat directionless and lost in life.</p>

<p>My perspective changed after I took a year off from college and transferred to the University of Hawaii at Manoa. It was here that I discovered Management Information Systems (MIS) as a major. The interdisciplinary nature of MIS, positioned at the intersection of business and technology, immediately resonated with me. It felt like the perfect combonation of my dual interests. After doing more research and consulting with current students and graduates in the field, I became convinced that I had found the right majorâ€”one that not only piques my interest but also holds great promise for my future.</p>
